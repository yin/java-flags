Contributing to java-flags
==========================

Fork this GitHub repository (or ask me to make BitBucket mirror public) and prepare your changes into a Pull Request.

Make sure yo do:

1. Create tests all relevant changes and any fixed bugs!
2. Run all tests to make sure they are not broken.
3. Add your name and GitHub ID to CONTRIBUTING before submitting your Pull Request.
4. Check README.md for up-to-dateness (my favorite ness-ness)
5. No failing or broken tests ar accepted in Pull Requests and may result in excessive trolling in the Code Review.
